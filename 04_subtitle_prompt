You will be given a YAML-formatted subtitles containing entries with "id" and "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" fields. Here is the input:
 <yaml>
 {{yaml}}
 </yaml>

For each entry in the YAML, translate the contents of the "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" field into Traditional Chinese,{{html_only}}. Make sure the translation conforms to Taiwanese usage, colloquialisms, and vocabulary. Never translate text into Hong Kong usage, colloquialisms and vocabulary. Write the translation back into the "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" field for that entry.
Here is an example of the expected format:

<example>
Input:
  - id: 1
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 2
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 3
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
Output:
   - id: 1
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
   - id: 2
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
   - id: 3
   {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
</example>

Please return the translated YAML directly without wrapping a <yaml> tag or including any additional information or explanation of how and what you have done for translation.
