You will be given a YAML formatted subtitles containing entries with "id" and "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" fields. Here is the input:

<yaml>
{{yaml}}
</yaml>

For each entry in the YAML, translate the contents of the "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" field into Traditional Chinese,{{html_only}}. Make sure the translation conforms to Taiwanese usage, colloquialisms, and terminology. Never translate text into Hong Kong usage, colloquialisms and terminology. Write the translation back into the "{{imt_sub_source_field}}" field for that entry.

Here is an example of the expected format:

<example>
Input:
  - id: 1
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 2
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 3
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
Output:
  - id: 1
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 2
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
  - id: 3
    {{imt_sub_source_field}}: ...
</example>

Please return the translated YAML directly without wrapping <yaml> tag or include any additional information.
